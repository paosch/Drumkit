# Drumkit #

A program written to practise Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
<br></br>
When one clicks on a certain keyboard key, the program plays the sound associated to that key and does a short animation (it pops the button up and gives it a yellow border).
<br></br>

To play the drums, go to https://paosch.github.io/Drumkit/
